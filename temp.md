To integrate test coverage with `coverage.py` and add coverage reporting to your GitHub Actions workflow, follow these steps:

### 1. Configure `coverage.py`

1. **Install `coverage.py`:**
   Add `coverage` to your project's dependencies. You can install it via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install coverage
   ```

2. **Create a Configuration File (Optional):**
   You can create a `.coveragerc` file in the root of your project to configure coverage settings. Here's a basic example:
   ```ini
   [run]
   branch = True
   source = your_project_name

   [report]
   omit =
       */migrations/*
       */tests/*
       */settings.py
   ```

   Replace `your_project_name` with the name of your project directory.

3. **Run Coverage Locally:**
   Before integrating with GitHub Actions, test coverage locally:
   ```bash
   coverage run manage.py test
   coverage report
   coverage html
   ```

   - `coverage run manage.py test` runs your tests and collects coverage data.
   - `coverage report` prints a coverage report to the terminal.
   - `coverage html` generates an HTML report in a directory named `htmlcov`.

### 2. Add Coverage Reporting to GitHub Actions Workflow

1. **Create or Edit Your GitHub Actions Workflow:**
   In your repository, create or edit a GitHub Actions workflow file located at `.github/workflows/test.yml` (or a similar path).

2. **Add Coverage Reporting Steps:**
   Here’s an example of a GitHub Actions workflow that includes test coverage reporting:
   ```yaml
   name: Test and Coverage

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main
     pull_request:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - name: Checkout code
         uses: actions/checkout@v3

       - name: Set up Python
         uses: actions/setup-python@v4
         with:
           python-version: '3.11'

       - name: Install dependencies
         run: |
           python -m pip install --upgrade pip
           pip install -r requirements.txt
           pip install coverage

       - name: Run tests with coverage
         run: |
           coverage run manage.py test
           coverage report
           coverage xml
           coverage html

       - name: Upload coverage report
         uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
         with:
           file: coverage.xml
           fail_ci_if_error: true
   ```

   - **`Set up Python`**: Sets up the Python environment.
   - **`Install dependencies`**: Installs project dependencies including `coverage`.
   - **`Run tests with coverage`**: Runs tests with coverage and generates reports.
   - **`Upload coverage report`**: Uploads the coverage report to [Codecov](https://codecov.io/) or another coverage service.

3. **Add Codecov Token (if needed):**
   If you’re using Codecov or a similar service, you may need to add a token as a GitHub Secrets. Go to your repository settings, then `Secrets` and add a new secret with the name `CODECOV_TOKEN`.

### 3. Verify Integration

1. **Push Changes:**
   Commit and push the workflow file to your repository:
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/test.yml
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow with coverage reporting"
   git push
   ```

2. **Check GitHub Actions:**
   Go to the `Actions` tab in your GitHub repository to see if the workflow runs successfully.

3. **Check Coverage Report:**
   If you’re using a coverage service like Codecov, you should see the coverage report on their website after the workflow completes.

By following these steps, you'll integrate test coverage into your CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that coverage is measured and reported with every test run.
